### :man_technologist: About Me :
So my journey into software began about 4 years although if I my confess my interest in software engineering has been there way before that. I always liked the idea of doing something that people would find useful and creating a product that is used by millions or hopefully billions of people has always been a dream of mine. Since then I have tried everything I can from design to backend development to frontend development to even taking a look at AI. My journey hasn't always been smooth as for some time now I have been dealing with depression and horrendous bouts of anxiety. I don't want this to be a sob story. What I want is to focus on my dreams and accomplish my goals and so from this moment 15/05/2023 I have resolved to move forward with everything I can. I hadn't made as much progress as I could thanks to my issues but hopefully I may overcome that.

When it comes to programming I have a love for python and Kotlin. I am not so fond of Java although I can work with it - haha. I have also worked with angular and tailwind on a couple of projects - man, I love tailwind CSS. I haven't worked on a lot of projects although I am going to rectify that. Please find a link to my portfolio website below.

So some projects I have worked on
- News Aggregator Application. Yeah this was an in-house application which I worked on at my previous company Turntabl. Was an app that aggregated Ghanaian and West African Tech news that it had gathered from various sources.
- MS Optimus Compiler - Worked on this project for about 7 months as a contingent software engineer for Morgan Stanley before I was kicked off the project due to being a slow learner. Not funny but I actually learned a lot from this project and I wish I could have contributed to it a lot longer.
- Crypto Wallet = A project I worked on with two colleagues of mine where we built a crypto wallet for a client. I worked on the frontend aspect of it first using Angular and then a bit of React. Was unfinished as the client was not very trustworthy.
- Travel and Tour Booking Application(Myma Air Travel and Tour). Created a simple booking application for a travel and tour company that enabled clients to book accomodation, travel and tour packages etc. Not deployed as I received no compensation for this. Also my very first Django project so forgive me if it isn't so sophisticated.
- Yeah then a few practice projects. Not going to mention them. You can have a look through my repositories though. Also in case I have not mentioned, planning to do open source ASAP.

Okay some other things I like doing - basically my interest.
- I love writing and although I haven't done it for a long time I am planning to do more of that. Will mostly be article writing, some self help and also my very first novel. Already have an idea for that.
- I love arts so drawing, painting and stuff like that are things I enjoy a lot.
- Music and instruments. Love all sorts of music from classical music to rap to reggae etc. Also learning how to play the piano.

PS: if you have taken a look at my git history, you won't see a lot of activity for 2 reasons.
1. I worked on private projects mostly
2. I had 2 different github accounts, one for work and then this. Merging the 2 made me lose about 2 years of work history as the projects were private.

Sorry if this is too much to read. I swear I am not this talkative but I am using writing as a sort of therapy to deal with my issues so sorry about that. If you have any questions though feel free to mail me here - apmensah@gmail.com
