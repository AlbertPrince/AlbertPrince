### :man_technologist: About Me :
So my journey into software began about 4 years although if I my confess my interest in software engineering has been there way before that. I always liked the idea of doing something that people would find useful and creating a product that is used by millions or hopefully billions of people has always been a dream of mine. Since then I have tried everything I can from design to backend development to frontend development to even taking a look at AI. 

When it comes to programming I have a love for python and Kotlin. I am not so fond of Java although I can work with it - haha. I have also worked with angular and tailwind on a couple of projects - man, I love tailwind CSS. I haven't worked on a lot of projects although I am going to rectify that. Please find a link to my portfolio website below.

So some projects I have worked on
- News Aggregator Application. Yeah this was an in-house application which I worked on at my previous company Turntabl. Was an app that aggregated Ghanaian and West African Tech news that it had gathered from various sources.
- MS Optimus Compiler - Worked on this project for about 7 months as a contingent software engineer for Morgan Stanley before I was kicked off the project due to being a slow learner. Not funny but I actually learned a lot from this project and I wish I could have contributed to it a lot longer.
- Crypto Wallet = A project I worked on with two colleagues of mine where we built a crypto wallet for a client. I worked on the frontend aspect of it first using Angular and then a bit of React. Was unfinished as the client was not very trustworthy.
- Travel and Tour Booking Application(Myma Air Travel and Tour). Created a simple booking application for a travel and tour company that enabled clients to book accomodation, travel and tour packages etc. Not deployed as I received no compensation for this. Also my very first Django project so forgive me if it isn't so sophisticated.
- Yeah then a few practice projects. Not going to mention them. You can have a look through my repositories though. Also in case I have not mentioned, planning to do open source ASAP.
